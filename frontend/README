Kernel-test web application
===========================

This is a small web application to display the results of the different
tests performed on kernels.

Requirements (as Fedora RPM):
- python-flask
- python-flask-wtf
- python-wtforms
- python-fedora-flask
- python-sqlalchemy


To run a development instance:

- Create the database
 $ python createdb.py

- Run the application
 $ python app.py

The application should be accessible at http//127.0.0.1:5000.
You might want to add your username to the list of ADMINS in default_config.py
to get access to the admin interface.
